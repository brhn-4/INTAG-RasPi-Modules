# INTAG-RaspberryPi-Control System
In this repository, you can find the modules, starter code, instructions, and demos for INTAG System's hydroponic control system on RaspberryPi4b using Python. The intended use of this project is to help create a working water control system for a hydroponic growing environment. With this project, one will be able to follow along with the guided lessons and complete modules to facilitate a deeper understanding of electrical circuits, hydroponics, python, and app development. The guided instructions take you through multiple lessons to achieve this, starting with basic circuits and setting up the Raspberry Pi OS and finishing with a control system connected to an app that can analyze the data from multiple sensors and alert students.
