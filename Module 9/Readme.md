# Project 9: Azure SQL Database
Due: _________ at 11:59 PM <br>
Points: __________


## Introduction:
Now we are going to be connecting our webserver and Python scripts to a cloud database! Specifically, we are going to be using Microsoft Azure SQL Database. Our goal for this module is to create a Microsoft Azure server, create an SQL database, and connect our app to this database to store our sensor readings. Once we have completed this module you will be able to view all of our readings and query the database to perform an analysis of the readings.

## Microsoft Azure:

Microsoft Azure is a cloud computing service created by Microsoft for building, testing, deploying, and managing applications and services through Microsoft-managed data centers. It provides a range of cloud services, including those for computing, analytics, storage, and networking. Users can pick and choose from these services to develop and scale new applications, or run existing applications, in the public cloud. Azure offers solutions for all industries through a comprehensive set of compliant offerings, integrated tools, DevOps, and a marketplace for building any application.
# Azure SQL Database:
On Microsoft Azure, we will be specifically using the SQL database. Microsoft Azure SQL Database is a fully managed relational cloud database service that provides SQL Server engine compatibility with built-in intelligence. It offers a scalable service that can handle large amounts of data and a wide range of transactional processing workloads. Azure SQL Database is designed to make managing and scaling applications easier with features like high availability, security, and recovery built into the service. It's suitable for a variety of applications, from small projects to large-scale enterprise use and will be perfect for our project.
