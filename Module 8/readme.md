# Project 8: Display Sensor Data
Due: _________ at 11:59 PM <br>
Points: __________


## Introduction
Now that we have created our web page framework, it's time to read in the data from our sensors. To combine our existing Python script with our new web page we will be using Flask and AJAX. This will give us the ability to call our Python script at a set interval of time and dynamically update our web page with new content.
<br><br>
## Flask / AJAX
For this project we will be using the DHT11 humidity sensor. There are two variants of the DHT11 that are commonly used. One is a three pin PCB mounted module and the other is a four pin stand-alone module. During this project we will be working with the 3 pin module with a breakout board include however, the pinout is different for each one, so if you have the 4 pin variant make sure to look online for the correct wiring.
